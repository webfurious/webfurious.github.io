<b>Important Notes for Alpha Testers</b><br>
This is a very early alpha — many sections <b>(e.g., full scheduling/tasks, financial summaries, reporting, advanced settings)</b> are still under development and not yet available.<br>
All data is stored securely in a private Firebase backend, <b>but please avoid entering sensitive real-world information (e.g., full payment details, personal IDs) during testing.</b><br>
Bugs, crashes, and incomplete features are expected. If you encounter any issues, please report them with screenshots, steps to reproduce, and device details<b> (Android version, model, etc.).</b> Your feedback is incredibly valuable!
Thank you again for your help in shaping StudioFlow.</p>
  <p>This is an early alpha version, so please note the following steps and important information:<br>
    <h4>Download the APK</h4>
    Click the link to download the installation file:
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fcjj1sf384bt0rghho887/StudioFlow_release.apk?rlkey=aowoolvkjry3m4h0xl56ymli8&st=cahj8nhl&dl=0>Download APK">StudioFlow—Aplha 0.01</a><br>
    <h4>Install the APK</h4>
Locate the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder) and tap it to begin installation.<br><br>
If prompted, enable <b>"Install unknown apps"</b> or <b>"Allow from this source"</b> in your browser or file manager (this is required because the APK is not yet signed by Google Play).<br><br>
On most Android devices:<br>
    <b>Settings → Apps → Special app access → Install unknown apps → select your browser or file manager → toggle "Allow from this source" on.</b>
<br><br>
    <b>Security Note</b><br>
Since this is an unsigned alpha build, Android may display a warning that the app is from an untrusted source. This is normal for non-Play Store APKs. The file is safe (it's built by me), but always scan with antivirus if you prefer extra peace of mind.
<br><br>
    <b>Troubleshooting</b><br>
If you encounter any installation issues (e.g., error messages, blocked install, or device-specific restrictions), please let me know with details<b> (Android version, device model, exact error message, screenshot if possible).</b><br> I'll help resolve it quickly.
Thank you again for testing and providing feedback. Your input is invaluable as development continues.<br>
