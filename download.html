    <h3>StudioFlow Alpha Release — Installation Instructions</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Features Available for Testing</b><br>
      This is an early build, so only a core subset of features is currently available and functional.<br>
      The app focuses on simple, effective business management for freelancers and small creative businesses.
      <br><br>

      <b>Currently Available Sections (Fully Functional with CRUD Operations)</b><br><br>

      <b>Client Management</b><br>
      — Create new clients<br>
      — View client details<br>
      — Edit existing client information<br>
      — Delete clients<br><br>

      <b>Project Management</b><br>
      — Create new projects (with client auto-complete/lookup from the Client database)<br>
      — View project details<br>
      — Edit project information<br>
      — Delete projects<br><br>

      <b>Invoice Management</b><br>
      — Create new invoices (with client and project auto-complete/lookup)<br>
      — View invoice details<br>
      — Edit invoice information<br>
      — Delete invoices<br><br>

      <b>Dashboard Overview</b><br>
      Displays recent activity (last 5 items) for clients, projects, and invoices<br>
      Shows due and overdue invoices with basic highlighting
      <br><br>

      <b>Important Notes for Alpha Testers</b><br>
      This is a very early alpha — many sections
      <b>(e.g., full scheduling/tasks, financial summaries, reporting, advanced settings)</b>
      are still under development and not yet available.<br>
      All data is stored securely in a private Firebase backend, but please avoid entering sensitive real-world information during testing.<br>
      Bugs, crashes, and incomplete features are expected. Your feedback is incredibly valuable.
